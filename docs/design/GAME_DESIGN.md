# VOIDSTRIKE - Design Document

## Overview

VOIDSTRIKE is a browser-based real-time strategy game built with modern web technologies. It features 3D graphics, competitive multiplayer, and deep strategic gameplay.

## Core Vision

**"Zero-friction competitive RTS"** - Click and play from any browser, no downloads required.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **Three.js / React Three Fiber** - 3D rendering engine
- **Next.js 14** - App Router, Server Components
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety
- **Zustand** - Game state management
- **Web Workers** - Pathfinding, AI, simulation offloading
- **WebGPU** (WebGL fallback) - Graphics performance
- **Howler.js** - Spatial audio

### Backend Stack (Supabase + Vercel)

- **Supabase Realtime** - WebSocket multiplayer
- **Supabase Database** - Player data, matches, rankings
- **Supabase Auth** - OAuth authentication
- **Supabase Edge Functions** - Game server logic
- **Vercel Edge Functions** - Matchmaking
- **Vercel KV** - Session state caching

## Game Architecture

### Entity Component System (ECS)

The game uses an ECS architecture for maximum performance and flexibility:

```
Entity: Unique ID
Components: Data containers (Position, Health, Selectable, etc.)
Systems: Logic processors (MovementSystem, CombatSystem, etc.)
```

### Game Loop

```
1. Process Inputs (player commands)
2. Run Systems (physics, AI, combat)
3. Update State (ECS world)
4. Render Frame (Three.js)
5. Sync Network (multiplayer only)
```

### Lockstep Simulation

For multiplayer, we use deterministic lockstep:

- All clients run identical simulations
- Only inputs are transmitted (not state)
- Periodic checksums detect desync
- Enables replay system for free

## Faction Design

### The Dominion (Humans)

- **Theme**: Military industrial complex
- **Playstyle**: Versatile, defensive, siege warfare
- **Unique Mechanics**:
  - Siege modes (units transform)
  - Bunkers and fortifications
  - Healing/repair units

### The Synthesis (Machine Consciousness)

- **Theme**: Transcendent AI collective
- **Playstyle**: Powerful but expensive, shield-based
- **Unique Mechanics**:
  - Warp-in (instant unit deployment)
  - Shield regeneration
  - Psionic abilities

### The Swarm (Organic Hive)

- **Theme**: Adaptive biological horror
- **Playstyle**: Cheap, fast, overwhelming
- **Unique Mechanics**:
  - Creep spread (terrain control)
  - Unit morphing/evolution
  - Passive regeneration

## Resource System

### Primary Resources

1. **Minerals** - Basic resource, abundant
2. **Plasma** - Advanced resource, limited

### Economy Flow

```
Workers -> Resource Nodes -> Storage -> Production
```

### Worker Saturation

Each resource node displays worker assignment status with floating labels showing "X/Y" (current/optimal):

| Resource Type | Optimal Workers | Max Useful Workers | Label Color                             |
| ------------- | --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Minerals**  | 2 per patch     | 3 per patch        | Green when saturated, Yellow when under |
| **Plasma**    | 3 per geyser    | 3 per geyser       | Green when saturated, Yellow when under |

- **Green (X/Y)**: Optimal saturation reached - maximum efficiency
- **Yellow (X/Y)**: Undersaturated - workers needed for optimal income
- **Gray (0/Y)**: No workers assigned

AI prioritizes filling extractors to 3 workers first, then distributes workers evenly across mineral patches (2 per patch optimal, 3 maximum).

## Combat System

### Auto-Attack Behavior

Units automatically engage enemies based on their state:

| Unit State        | Target Acquisition            | Notes                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Idle**          | Immediate within attack range | Instant response, no throttle delay |
| **Hold Position** | Within attack range only      | Won't move to engage                |
| **Patrolling**    | Within sight range            | Engages then resumes patrol         |
| **Attack-Moving** | Within sight range            | Engages then resumes move           |

**Targeting Priority** (higher = attacked first):

1. Devastators, Dreadnoughts, Colossus (90-100) - High threat units
2. Specters, Operatives, Breachers (70-85) - Tactical threats
3. Troopers, Scorchers, Valkyries (50-60) - Standard combat
4. Vanguards, Lifters (40-45) - Support units
5. Buildings (30) - Structures
6. Workers (10) - Lowest priority

Target scoring also considers:

- **Distance** - Closer enemies are prioritized
- **Health** - Damaged enemies are prioritized

### Attack Targeting Types

Units have restrictions on what they can attack based on air/ground targeting:

| Target Type      | Can Attack Ground | Can Attack Air | Example Units                                                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ground & Air** | ✅                | ✅             | Trooper, Breacher, Colossus, Specter, Dreadnought (continuous laser) |
| **Ground Only**  | ✅                | ❌             | Fabricator, Scorcher, Devastator, Valkyrie (Assault Mode)            |
| **Air Only**     | ❌                | ✅             | Valkyrie (Fighter Mode)                                              |
| **No Attack**    | ❌                | ❌             | Lifter, Overseer                                                     |

**Transform Mode Targeting**: Some units change targeting when transforming:

- **Valkyrie Fighter Mode** (flying): Air only - anti-air specialist
- **Valkyrie Assault Mode** (ground): Ground only - ground assault
- **Devastator/Scorcher**: Ground only in all modes (artillery/flamethrower)

**AI Transform Intelligence**: AI-controlled units intelligently transform based on nearby enemy composition:

- **Valkyrie**: Transforms to Fighter Mode when air enemies present (no ground), Assault Mode when ground enemies present (no air). Uses threat scores for mixed situations.
- **Scorcher**: Transforms to Inferno mode (area-of-effect) when 2+ enemies are nearby, reverts to Scorcher mode (mobile) when no enemies in range.

**AI Counter-Building**: When AI units are attacked by enemies they cannot hit (e.g., air units attacking ground-only troops), the AI urgently prioritizes building anti-air capable units.

### AI Air Unit Control

The AI manages air units as an independent tactical arm:

**Air Combat Units** (Valkyrie, Specter, Dreadnought):

- Separated from ground army during attacks
- Execute flanking maneuvers perpendicular to the main ground attack
- Perform hit-and-run micro (reposition after attacking)
- Disengage automatically when health drops below 30%
- Used for worker harassment between major attacks

**Air Support Units** (Lifter, Overseer):

- Follow the main army at a safe distance behind the centroid
- Provide healing (Lifter) and detection (Overseer) support
- Not included in combat formations

**Valkyrie Transform Intelligence**:

- Switches to Fighter mode when air threats dominate (1.5x threshold)
- Switches to Assault mode when ground threats dominate (1.5x threshold)
- More aggressive mode-switching than previous 2x threshold

**Air Production Priority**:

- Valkyrie: priority 54 (primary air unit)
- Specter: priority 52 (cloaked strike)
- Dreadnought: priority 58 (capital ship)
- Air Superiority response: priority 75 when enemy has air
- Emergency anti-air: priority 95 on all difficulties

### AI Personality System

Each AI player is assigned a personality that determines its strategic behavior, army composition, and build order selection. In multi-AI games, personalities are varied so no two AIs play identically.

| Personality    | Style            | Early Game                             | Late Game                             |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Balanced**   | Well-rounded     | Trooper/Breacher/Vanguard mix          | Diverse army with all unit types      |
| **Aggressive** | Fast pressure    | Scorcher/Vanguard heavy, early attacks | Valkyrie/Specter focused              |
| **Defensive**  | Fortify & tech   | Trooper/Breacher/Devastator            | Colossus/Dreadnought deathball        |
| **Economic**   | Greedy expansion | Light defense, fast expand             | Colossus/Dreadnought/Operative heavy  |
| **Cheese**     | All-in rush      | Scorcher/Vanguard rush                 | Pivots to Valkyrie/Devastator if held |
| **Turtle**     | Slow & steady    | Trooper/Devastator behind defenses     | Colossus/Dreadnought siege force      |

Personality affects:

- **Build order selection**: Each personality prefers matching build order styles (e.g., aggressive AI picks aggressive openers)
- **Composition goals**: Per-phase army composition targets that drive production scoring
- **Macro rules**: Personality-filtered rules for extra production buildings, earlier expansions, etc.
- **Attack timing**: More aggressive personalities attack earlier and with smaller armies

### Damage Types

- **Normal** - Standard damage
- **Explosive** - Bonus vs large, reduced vs small
- **Concussive** - Bonus vs small, reduced vs large
- **Psionic** - Ignores armor

### Armor Types

- **Light** - Infantry, workers
- **Armored** - Vehicles, heavy units
- **Massive** - Capital ships, structures
- **Naval** - Ships and submarines
- **Shields** - Synthesis units (regenerates)

## Naval Combat

### Movement Domains

Units have a movement domain that determines where they can move:

| Domain         | Land | Shallow Water   | Deep Water | Air |
| -------------- | ---- | --------------- | ---------- | --- |
| **Ground**     | ✅   | ✅ (0.6x speed) | ❌         | ❌  |
| **Water**      | ❌   | ✅              | ✅         | ❌  |
| **Amphibious** | ✅   | ✅              | ✅         | ❌  |
| **Air**        | ✅   | ✅              | ✅         | ✅  |

### Naval Targeting

| Unit Type        | Can Attack Ground | Can Attack Air | Can Attack Naval |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| **Ground Units** | ✅ (varies)       | ✅ (varies)    | ❌ (most)        |
| **Naval Units**  | ✅ (varies)       | ✅ (varies)    | ✅               |
| **Air Units**    | ✅ (varies)       | ✅ (varies)    | ✅ (most)        |

### Torpedo Damage Type

New damage type for anti-ship weapons:

| Torpedo vs | Multiplier |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Light      | 0.5x       |
| Armored    | 0.75x      |
| Massive    | 1.0x       |
| Naval      | 1.5x       |
| Structure  | 1.25x      |

### Submarine Mechanics

Submarines (Hunter) have special submerge mechanics:

- **Surfaced**: Normal speed, can use deck gun, visible
- **Submerged**: Reduced speed (67%), cloaked, torpedo attacks only
- Detected by: Radar Array, Overseer, other submarines (sonar)

### Shore Bombardment

Naval capital ships (Leviathan) can attack land targets:

- Normal attack range applies to coastal targets
- Shore Bombardment ability: Long-range artillery strike (75 energy)
- Yamato Cannon: 150 damage single target (100 energy)

```

### Control Scheme

- **Left Click** - Select unit/building
- **Right Click** - Move/Attack/Interact
- **Shift+Right Click** - Queue command (chain commands)
- **Shift+A Click** - Queue attack-move
- **Box Drag** - Multi-select
- **Ctrl+#** - Create control group
- **#** - Select control group
- **A** - Attack move
- **S** - Stop
- **H** - Hold position
- **P** - Patrol

### Command Queuing (Shift-Click)

Hold **Shift** while issuing commands to queue them in sequence:

- Units execute commands in order, proceeding to next when current completes
- Works with: Move, Attack, Attack-Move, Patrol, Gather
- Green waypoint indicators show queued destinations for selected units
- Press **S** (Stop) to clear all queued commands

### Building Placement Queuing (Shift-Click)

Hold **Shift** while placing buildings to queue multiple placements:

- Each shift-click places a building and stays in placement mode
- Green dashed path lines connect queued building positions (rally point style)
- Workers are assigned to each building as they become available
- Release shift and click to place final building and exit placement mode

### Unit Movement Behavior

Units use **magic box detection** for natural movement behavior:

| Command Location          | Behavior         | Description                                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inside Selection Box**  | Clump            | All units move to the same point, then spread naturally |
| **Outside Selection Box** | Preserve Spacing | Units maintain their relative positions                 |

**Arrival Spreading:**

- Units clump while moving (weak separation) for faster group movement
- On arrival, strong separation kicks in causing natural spreading
- Prevents splash damage from grouped units

**Explicit Formations:**

- `F` + click - Open formation menu (select: box, wedge, line, etc.)
- Units automatically sort: melee front, ranged back, support center

**Available Formations:**

- **Box** - Balanced defensive, ranged protected in center
- **Wedge** - V-shaped aggressive formation
- **Line** - Horizontal spread, good for narrow chokes
- **Column** - Single file for narrow passages
- **Scatter** - Random spread for anti-splash
- **Circle** - Defensive circle with support center
- **Siege Line** - Infantry front, artillery back

### Movement Speeds & Acceleration

Units have differentiated movement speeds and acceleration rates:

**Unit Speed Reference (Dominion Faction):**

| Unit            | Role           | Speed     | Acceleration | Feel               |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| **Fabricator**  | Worker         | 4.0       | 50           | Quick worker       |
| **Trooper**     | Infantry       | 3.15      | 1000         | Instant/snappy     |
| **Breacher**    | Heavy Infantry | 3.15      | 1000         | Instant/snappy     |
| **Vanguard**    | Recon          | 5.25      | 1000         | Fast & snappy      |
| **Operative**   | Stealth        | 3.94      | 1000         | Instant/snappy     |
| **Scorcher**    | Light Vehicle  | 5.95      | 800          | Fast vehicle       |
| **Devastator**  | Siege          | 3.15      | 800          | Heavy vehicle      |
| **Colossus**    | Heavy Mech     | 2.62      | 600          | Slow heavy mech    |
| **Lifter**      | Transport      | 3.5       | 3.15         | Floaty transport   |
| **Valkyrie**    | Transform      | 3.85/3.15 | 4.55         | Responsive fighter |
| **Specter**     | Strike Craft   | 3.85      | 4.55         | Strike craft       |
| **Dreadnought** | Capital Ship   | 2.62      | 1.4          | Sluggish capital   |
| **Overseer**    | Support        | 4.13      | 2.975        | Support craft      |

**Acceleration System:**

Acceleration creates distinct unit "feels":

| Unit Type           | Acceleration | Deceleration | Behavior                 |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Ground Combat**   | 800-1000     | 2x accel     | Near-instant response    |
| **Ground Vehicles** | 600-800      | 2x accel     | Slightly visible ramp-up |
| **Workers**         | 50           | 100          | Visible but quick        |
| **Light Air**       | 4-5          | 2x accel     | Responsive but floaty    |
| **Medium Air**      | 2.5-3.5      | 2x accel     | Standard air unit        |
| **Heavy Air**       | 1.4-1.5      | 2x accel     | Sluggish capital ship    |

**Key Mechanics:**

- Ground combat units have effectively instant acceleration (1000) for responsive micro
- Air units have gradual acceleration (1-5) creating a "floaty" feel
- Deceleration is typically 2x acceleration for snappy stops
- Workers have visible acceleration for better game feel
- Heavy units (Colossus, Dreadnought) feel appropriately weighty

## Map Design

### Map Design Principles

All maps follow classic RTS design principles:

1. **Protected Main Bases** - Each main base is ~90% enclosed by cliffs with a single narrow ramp exit
2. **Defensive Natural Expansions** - Natural expansions have chokepoints for defensive play
3. **Contested Center** - Central area with watch towers for map control
4. **Multiple Expansion Tiers** - Main → Natural → Third → Fourth → Gold bases
5. **Narrow Ramps** - 6-10 tile wide ramps for wall-offs and defense
6. **256-Level Elevation System** - 0-255 height levels for smooth terrain (gameplay zones: low 0-85, mid 86-170, high 171-255)

### Terrain Feature System

Maps now include diverse terrain features that affect gameplay:

| Feature             | Walkable | Buildable | Speed | Vision  | Notes                         |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----- | ------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Water (shallow)** | Yes      | No        | 0.6x  | Clear   | Rivers, ponds                 |
| **Water (deep)**    | No       | No        | -     | Clear   | Lakes, impassable             |
| **Forest (light)**  | Yes      | No        | 0.85x | Partial | Small trees, slight cover     |
| **Forest (dense)**  | Yes      | No        | 0.5x  | Blocked | Hides units, ambush positions |
| **Mud/Swamp**       | Yes      | No        | 0.4x  | Clear   | Significant slow zone         |
| **Road**            | Yes      | No        | 1.25x | Clear   | Fast movement corridors       |
| **Void**            | No       | No        | -     | Clear   | Map edges, chasms             |
| **Cliff**           | No       | No        | -     | Blocked | Sheer drops                   |

### Strategic Terrain Elements

Each map now includes:

- **Forest Corridors** - Paths with dense trees on sides, clear roads in center
- **River Crossings** - Water barriers with bridge chokepoints
- **Void Chasms** - Impassable areas at map edges/corners
- **Road Networks** - Fast movement highways connecting key areas
- **Ambush Forests** - Dense forest patches for hiding armies
- **Mud Zones** - Contested areas with movement penalties

### Available Maps

| Map                | Players | Size    | Biome    | Terrain Features                              |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Crystal Caverns    | 2       | 200×180 | Frozen   | Frozen lakes, ice corridors, icy slow zones   |
| Void Assault       | 2       | 220×220 | Void     | Void chasms, alien forests, energy pools      |
| Scorched Basin     | 4       | 280×280 | Desert   | Lava lakes, scorched forests, sand slow zones |
| Contested Frontier | 6       | 360×320 | Jungle   | Rivers with bridges, dense jungle, mud pits   |
| Titan's Colosseum  | 8       | 400×400 | Volcanic | Lava moats, volcanic pits, highway system     |

### Expansion Types (Standard Resource Amounts)

- **Standard Bases** (Main/Natural/Third) - 8 mineral patches: 6× 1500 + 2× 900 (close patches) = 10,800 total minerals
- **Gold Bases** - 8 mineral patches: 8× 900 = 7,200 total minerals (higher mining rate per patch)
- **Gas Geysers** - All geysers contain 2,250 plasma gas

Base Protection Levels:

- **Main Base** - Starting location, protected by cliffs with single ramp
- **Natural** - Close to main, semi-protected chokepoint
- **Third** - Contested, requires army presence
- **Gold** - High-risk high-reward, exposed position
- **Center** - Highly contested map control position

### High Ground Advantage

The combat system uses the elevation system:

- Attacking from low → high ground: 30% miss chance
- Attacking from low → mid ground: 15% miss chance
- Attacking from mid → high ground: 15% miss chance
- Same or higher elevation: No penalty

### Spawn Point Rules

- Only main base locations are valid spawn points
- Each player slot (1-8) maps to a specific main base
- AI and human players are assigned to main bases only
- Expansion locations are never spawn points

## Building Construction System

### Dominion Construction Mechanics

The Dominion faction uses worker-based construction where Fabricators physically construct buildings:

**Construction Flow:**

1. Player selects a worker and places a building blueprint
2. Worker is assigned and moves to the construction site
3. Worker is "locked" to construction - they stay there building unless explicitly commanded to move
4. Construction progresses only while a worker is actively present at the site
5. When complete, the worker is released and returns to idle state

**Paused Construction:**

- If a worker is moved away from a construction site (via move command, gather, attack, repair), construction pauses
- The building remains at its current progress and health, waiting for a worker
- Any worker can resume construction by right-clicking on the paused building
- Paused buildings are NOT cancelled automatically - they persist indefinitely

**Worker Assignment:**

- Multiple workers can be assigned to the same building for faster construction
- Workers are automatically released when construction completes
- If the building is destroyed, assigned workers are released

**Building States:**
| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `waiting_for_worker` | Blueprint placed, worker assigned but not arrived |
| `constructing` | Worker actively building, health increasing |
| `paused` | Construction started but no worker present |
| `complete` | Building finished, fully operational |

**Right-Click on Buildings:**

- Right-clicking a friendly under-construction building with workers selected assigns them to resume construction
- This works for `waiting_for_worker`, `constructing`, and `paused` buildings
- Visual feedback: yellow flash on building when construction is resumed

**Blueprint Cancellation:**

- Only blueprints in `waiting_for_worker` state (never started) are cancelled if no worker is assigned
- Resources are fully refunded for cancelled blueprints
- Once construction starts (`constructing` or `paused`), the building persists

## Fortification System

### Wall Buildings

| Building         | Size | Cost        | HP  | Armor | Description                                          |
| ---------------- | ---- | ----------- | --- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wall Segment** | 1×1  | 25 minerals | 400 | 1     | Basic wall, connects to neighbors, can mount turrets |
| **Wall Gate**    | 2×1  | 75 minerals | 500 | 2     | Entrance gate, opens for friendly units              |

### Wall Line Placement

Walls use a special **click+drag placement mode**:

1. Select a worker and choose "Build Walls" (W)
2. Select wall type (Wall Segment or Gate)
3. **Click** to start wall line
4. **Drag** to preview wall path (snaps to straight lines)
5. **Release** to place all wall segments
6. Workers are automatically assigned round-robin

**Path Snapping:**

- Walls draw in straight lines only (horizontal, vertical, or 45° diagonal)
- Real-time cost display during drag
- Invalid positions shown in red

### Gate Mechanics

| State              | Behavior                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Open**           | Allows all units to pass                         |
| **Closed**         | Blocks all units                                 |
| **Auto** (default) | Opens for friendly units, closes after 2 seconds |
| **Locked**         | Permanently closed until unlocked                |

**Gate Commands:**

- `O` - Toggle Open/Close
- `L` - Lock/Unlock
- `A` - Set to Auto mode

### Wall Connections

Walls automatically connect to adjacent walls:

- Single segment: `■`
- Horizontal: `═══`
- Vertical: `║`
- Corners: `╔ ╗ ╚ ╝`
- T-junctions: `╦ ╩ ╠ ╣`
- Cross: `╬`

### Wall Upgrades

Upgrades are researched at Arsenal/Tech Center, then applied per-segment:

| Upgrade                | Research Cost | Apply Cost | Effect                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Reinforced Plating** | 100/100       | 25/0       | +400 HP, +2 armor                 |
| **Shield Generator**   | 150/150       | 50/25      | +200 regenerating shield          |
| **Integrated Weapons** | 100/100       | 40/25      | Adds auto-turret (5 dmg, 6 range) |
| **Repair Drone**       | 75/75         | 30/15      | Auto-heals adjacent walls         |

### Turret Mounting

- Defense Turrets can be placed **on top of** wall segments
- Mounted turrets gain +1 range and high-ground advantage
- Wall with mounted turret cannot be upgraded to Weapon Wall
- If wall is destroyed, mounted turret is also destroyed

## Performance Targets

- 60 FPS with 200 units on screen
- < 100ms input latency (multiplayer)
- < 5 second initial load
- Support for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 game modes
