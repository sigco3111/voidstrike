## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Critical)

1. UI sounds (click, error, select)
2. Voice announcements (under attack, unit lost, supply blocked)
3. Combat sounds (explosions, impacts)
4. Basic unit command sounds (move, attack, ready)

### Phase 2 (Important)

1. Building sounds
2. Ambient sounds (biome-specific)
3. Menu music
4. Gameplay music (1-2 tracks)

### Phase 3 (Polish)

1. Additional music tracks (8 gameplay tracks ✓)
2. Unit voice lines (select, move, attack, ready)
3. Advanced ability sounds
4. Victory/defeat music

## Notes

The audio system includes graceful fallback:

- Missing files generate procedural beeps as placeholders
- Categories have different fallback tones:
  - UI: 800Hz sine wave
  - Combat: 200Hz sine wave
  - Other: 400Hz sine wave
- Fallback sounds are very quiet (10% volume) to not be disruptive

### AI Generation Tips

1. **For Music Tracks**:
   - Request seamless loops explicitly
   - Specify "no fade out" for looping tracks
   - Use "inspired by classic military RTS games" for style reference
   - Request "game-ready, normalized audio"

2. **For Sound Effects**:
   - Keep durations short and punchy
   - Request "no reverb tail" for clean loops
   - Specify exact duration needed
   - Ask for "game-ready, clipping-free audio"

3. **For Voice Lines**:
   - Describe the character personality
   - Reference classic RTS games for style
   - Request "clean recording, no background noise"
   - Specify emotion and intensity
