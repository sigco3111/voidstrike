## Animation Requirements

### Required Animations Per Unit

All animated units should have these **three core animations** embedded in the GLB file:

| Animation Name | Alternative Names                          | Description                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `idle`         | `stand`, `idle_pose`, `*idle*`, `*stand*`  | Default stationary pose, loops continuously    |
| `walk`         | `run`, `move`, `*walk*`, `*run*`, `*move*` | Movement animation, loops while unit is moving |
| `attack`       | `shoot`, `fire`, `*attack*`, `*shoot*`     | Combat attack animation, plays when attacking  |

**Auto-mapping:** The system automatically maps animation names containing keywords. For example:

- `marine_idle_standing` → maps to `idle`
- `scv_walk_cycle` → maps to `walk`
- `attack_rifle_shoot` → maps to `attack`

### Animation Specifications

| Property   | Requirement                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Format     | Embedded in GLB (not separate files)                            |
| Frame rate | 24-30 FPS                                                       |
| Loop       | `idle` and `walk` should loop seamlessly                        |
| Duration   | `idle`: 2-4 sec, `walk`: 0.5-1 sec cycle, `attack`: 0.5-1.5 sec |
